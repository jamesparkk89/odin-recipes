        <p>If you're looking for the best French toast recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand.</p>
        <p>It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen - you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>White Bread: 6 Thick Slices</li>
            <p>Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones. </p>
            <li>Eggs: 2 Large Eggs</li>
            <p>When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.  </p>
            <li>Milk: 2/3 cups</li>
            <p>You can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. This recipe calls for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk - full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency. </p>
            <li>Vanilla and Cinnamon: 1 tsp Vanilla Extract and 1/4 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
            <p>The best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.</p>
            <li>Salt: to Taste</li>
            <p>Don't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and prevents egg chunks in the finished product.</p>
            <li>Butter: 1 Tablespoon Unsalted Butter</li>
            <p>Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.</p>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Lightly butter a griddle and heat over medium-high heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides. Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot.</p>
